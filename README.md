# Toy Star
## Description
This is a project for course DD2358 High performance computing.

This purpose of the project was to take initial code from 
https://github.com/pmocz/sph-python

And then to optimize the code to run faster.

## Usage and Dependencies
### Python
You need python to run this project.

Some packages may need to be downloaded using pip, so once you have python you 
can try to run the code and download missing packages using:

pip install <packagename>


### Cuda
You can run the project without Cuda. But to fully utilize the project and run it on the GPU you need to have cuda installed. This requires that you have nvidia GPU, and a sufficiant amount of vram on your computer.

## Results
When you run the code a window should pop up, showing a simulation of a star
